Main objective is to find the direction without the joker moves, then whichever is the direction put all jokers to that side.



## Method 1

One pass for the arg string thus a bit faster. Uses a bit more memory for two integers stored.

## Method 2

Three passes for each string so a bit slower but uses no additional memory.
